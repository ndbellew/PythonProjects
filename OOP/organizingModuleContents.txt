we could at a point want to call in a module in order to access the variable
database given the example 

class Database:
    # the database implementation
    pass

database = Database()

however this puts stress on the program because the database is created as
soon as the module is called - start up of the program. so instead what you
could do is modify the program to have a function initialize database when
needed: 

class Database:
    # the database implementation
    pass

database = None

def initialize_database():
    global database
    database = Database()
